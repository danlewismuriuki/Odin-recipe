    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        A cake is a sweet, baked dish made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, and is usually baked. 
        In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.

         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Flour: Flour is the main ingredient in a cake. It provides the structure and body of the cake.</li>
    <li> Sugar: Sugar is the sweetener in a cake. It also helps to tenderize the cake and give it a moist texture.</li>
    <li>Eggs: Eggs are the binding agent in a cake. They help to hold the cake together and give it a light and airy texture.</li>
    <li>Fat: Fat, such as butter or oil, helps to keep the cake moist and tender.</li>
    <li> Liquid: Liquid, such as milk or water, helps to dissolve the ingredients and make the batter smooth.</li>
    <li> Leavening: Leavening is what makes the cake rise. It can be baking powder, baking soda, or a combination of both.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
